    Most <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> elements are a member of one or more <em>content
      categories</em> â€” these categories group elements that share common characteristics. This is a loose grouping (it
    doesn't actually create a relationship among elements of these categories), but they help define and describe the
    categories' shared behavior and their associated rules, <i><strong>especially</strong></i> when you come upon their
    intricate details. It's also possible for elements to not be a <small>member of any of these categories.</small>
